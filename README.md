# **HOLBERTON SCHOOL-MONTY LANGUAGE INTERPRETE**

## Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Compilation and Output

- Compile your code this way:
  - gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
  - usage: ./monty <filename>
  - filename should contain the opcode
  - one opcode per line
  - spaces and newlines are ignored
  - '#' sign represent comments and the line will be ignored

## Main files code

## Secondary files code
